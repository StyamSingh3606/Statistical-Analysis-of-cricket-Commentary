Ball: 49.6	Delivery: Jasprit Bumrah to Jhye Richardson
Commentary:  out, 1 run, OUT! Richardson is short as they referred for a run out appeal upstairs. A yorker on middle, this is flicked towards mid-wicket. The batsmen take one and then they go for the second which was never on. Dhawan in the deep fires it to the keeper who collects it and throws it at the stumps.
